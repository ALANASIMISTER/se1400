            This website was frustrating at first because it was asking me to book in an annoying pop up before I was
            even able to look through the site. There was no interesting pictures or anything that captured my eye right
            of the bat, and i had to navigate to find face painting. There was no easy way to see the work of the
            business, but they did make it <i>really</i> easy to book. Also looked outdated.

            This website was really good advertising and a lot of examples of work shown, website works well and is easy
            to navigate. The way to book is only throuh calling and texting the number, and not on an online booking
            service. This isnt very professional and also its not ideal to have your personal phone number on a business
            website.

            This is pretty good competition. It had all the services clearly listed and also had pricing and many
            example pictures. This website also had the ability to book online as well. The only thing was that it said
            it wasnt secured and that sets off an alarm bell in my brain for some reason. (Thanks internet safety
            classes in elementary!) </p>

            This was by far the best website out of all of them. It was layed out really well, had many example pictures
            and made it easy to contact and book. Very organized and the most appealing to the eyes.
